XXIV Let it always appear and be manifest unto thee that
solitariness, and desert places, by many philosophers so
much esteemed of and affected, are of themselves but thus
and thus; and that all things are them <b>to</b> them that
live in towns, and converse with others as they are the same
nature everywhere to be seen and observed: to them that have
retired themselves to the top of mountains, and to desert
havens, or what <b>other</b> desert and inhabited places
soever. For anywhere it thou wilt mayest thou quickly find
and apply that to thyself; which Plato saith of his
philosopher, in a place: as private and retired, saith he,
as if he were shut up and enclosed about in some shepherd's
lodge, on the top of a hill. There by thyself to put these
questions to thyself or to enter in these considerations:
What is my chief and principal part, which hath power over
the rest? What is now the present estate of it, as I use it;
and what is it, that I employ it about? Is it now void of
reason ir no? Is it free, and separated; or so affixed, so
congealed and grown together as it were with the flesh, that
it <b>is</b> swayed by the motions and inclinations of it?
