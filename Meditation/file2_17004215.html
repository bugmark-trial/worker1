'It is very nice of you,' he writes to Fronto,(1) 'to ask
for my hexameters; I would have sent them at once if I had
them by me. The fact is my secretary, Anicetus-you know who
I mean-did not pack up any of my compositions for me to take
away with me. He knows my weakness; he was afraid that if I
got hold of them I might, as usual, make smoke of them.
However, there was no fear for the hexameters. I must
confess the truth to my master: I <b>love</b> them. I study
at night, since the day is taken up with the theatre. I am
weary of an evening, and sleepy in the daylight, and so I
don't do much. Yet I have made extracts from sixty books,
five volumes of them, in these latter days. But when you
read remember that the "sixty" includes plays of Novius, and
farces, and some little speeches of Scipio; don't be too
much startled at the number. You remember your Polemon; but
I pray you do not remember Horace, who has died with Pollio
as far as I am <b>concerned.(2)</b> Farewell, my dearest and
most affectionate friend, most distinguished consul
<b>and</b> my beloved master, whom I have not seen these two
years. Those who say two months, count the days. Shall I
ever see you again?'
